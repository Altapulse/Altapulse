                <h2><strong>How to Set Up WhatsApp Cloud API for Your Business</strong></h2>
                <p>Setting up the WhatsApp Cloud API is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to integrate WhatsApp messaging with your business:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Link with Altapulse’s WhatsApp Business App:</strong> The first step is to connect your WhatsApp Business account with Altapulse’s app. This integration makes it easy to manage customer communications and messaging workflows from one central platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Configure Webhooks & Secure API Access:</strong> Webhooks are essential for receiving real-time notifications, such as message status updates or incoming customer messages. Configure your webhooks to ensure secure and seamless communication with Meta’s servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Your Meta Business Manager Account:</strong> To get started, you’ll need a Meta Business Manager account. This platform allows you to manage all your business assets, including WhatsApp API access, message templates, and customer interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify Your Business Number:</strong> Before you can start using the WhatsApp API, Meta requires you to verify your business number. This step ensures that your WhatsApp number is legitimate and ready to handle customer communications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Functionality, Approve Templates, and Integrate with Your Tools:</strong> Use Meta’s sandbox environment to test the functionality of the API. Once everything works as expected, you’ll need to approve any message templates for automated communication. Finally, integrate WhatsApp with your CRM, customer support, or marketing tools to streamline your processes.</li>
